Guided by an Arlington-based [volunteer board of directors](/yourarlington.org/board/), YourArlington seeks support from individuals, families, organizations and businesses who, as we do, believe that an informed public is essential to democracy.  As a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, individual donations are tax deductible for most donors.
