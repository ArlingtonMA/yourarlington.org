YourArlington began as an experiment in community journalism dedicated to reporting news about Arlington, Mass., and the Arlington-related views of its residents. That experiment continues, but it is not unique -- it is part of a nationwide movement once called "[citizen journalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_journalism)."

The phrase gained currency through *[We the Media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_the_Media)*, a 2004 book by Arizona State University professor Dan Gillmor. This kind of journalism encourages members of a community to write about that community; the writing may be reporting, or it may be opinion.
