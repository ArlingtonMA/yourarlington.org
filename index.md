Welcome to the Your Arlington-org, Inc. homepage for the non-profit arm of your [favorite Arlington news site](https://yourarlington.com/?np)!

### All About The Nonprofit

*TODO Example pages the non-profit might want to highlight somehow.*

- [About Your Arlington](/yourarlington.org/about/)
- [Board of Directors](/yourarlington.org/board/)
- [Donate!](/yourarlington.org/donate/)
- [Volunteer](/yourarlington.org/volunteer/)
- Non-profit Policies
- [Your Arlington History](/yourarlington.org/history /)
- Editorial Independence

### What This Website Is Currently

This is a **proof of concept** of what an `yourarlington.org` website *could* be, to allow the non-profit to showcase itself more easily, and keep clear the editorial independence of the newspaper.  It's up to the Board to decide if a website like this is needed or not.  **IMPORTANT:** having this website would not affect any content on the news site, except that Donate! links would point here. 

This is hosted on GitHub Pages, meaning hosting is free of both cost and any maintenance.  Shane built this entire site in half a day, and can volunteer to do all basic maintenance.  Shane can also help [train](https://stackedit.io/) a few folks on how to use [GitHub Pages and Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax); there are plenty of [tutorials for non-coders](https://dannguyen.github.io/github-for-portfolios/).  All work is done through your web browser; no tools required.  You can see the [source for this page in GitHub](https://github.com/ArlingtonMA/yourarlington.org/blob/main/index.md).
